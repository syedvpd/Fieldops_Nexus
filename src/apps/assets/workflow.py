"""Asset status lifecycle (HPE: ACTIVE -> UNDER MAINTENANCE -> OUT OF SERVICE -> ACTIVE / RETIRED / DISPOSED).

Allowed transitions (anything else is rejected with HTTP 409 ``invalid_transition``):

    ACTIVE            --start_maintenance-->    UNDER_MAINTENANCE
    UNDER_MAINTENANCE --complete_maintenance--> ACTIVE
    UNDER_MAINTENANCE --mark_out_of_service-->  OUT_OF_SERVICE
    OUT_OF_SERVICE    --return_to_service-->    ACTIVE
    OUT_OF_SERVICE    --retire-->               RETIRED     (terminal)
    OUT_OF_SERVICE    --dispose-->              DISPOSED    (terminal)

``complete_maintenance`` (the maintenance outcome that keeps the asset) is the natural reading of the HPE
chain; retire / dispose are refused while the asset still has live components or a live parent (hierarchy
integrity, D-062); direct ACTIVE -> OUT_OF_SERVICE is intentionally NOT allowed (see docs/DECISIONS.md D-027).
