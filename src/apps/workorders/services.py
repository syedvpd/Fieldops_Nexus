"""M06 service layer (work-order lifecycle, assignment, labor / material capture, evidence, closure rules).

Callers (API/UI) resolve objects through organization- and site-scoped selectors and check the permission for the
order's site first; this layer enforces the rest: tenant ownership of references, the state machine, assignment
validity (active technician with start rights, no overlapping commitment), the assignee-only rule for execution,
closure rules, append-only events, one audit record per change, all in one transaction.

Boundary with M05: when a work order was created from a service request, the request-side effects (start
service, resolve, rework, cancel) are applied through ``incidents.services.on_work_order_*``; M06 never edits
request rows itself. M08 checklists are consulted through ``checklist_blockers``; M09 stock through
``part_blockers`` (closure) and ``inventory.services.on_work_order_closed / _cancelled`` (D-042).
